# GSF2App
Implementation of the Global and Semantic Feature Fusion Approach (GSF2App) for Indoor Scene Classification using the PyTorch framework. 

Summary: GSF2App is a two-branches network. In the first branch a state-of-the-art CNN is used to extract global features from the RGB indoor scene image. In the second branch, semantic features based on the YOLOv3's recognized objects, were developed.
